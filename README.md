# HEVC Packet Loss Toolchain

The **HEVC Packet Loss Toolchain** is a useful tool which is able to encode raw
video material with different settings and stream the encoded results via
pre-defined network configurations in order to insert packet loss resp.
delay/jitter. The transmitted videos are decoded back and can be used to compare
with the original video. It is also possible to insert the loss behaviour
offline, without streaming the content over a physical network.
